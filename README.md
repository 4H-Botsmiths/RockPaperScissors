## Getting Started

RockPaperScissors is a Java console app that is used to help teach a First Tech Challenge team how to build and debug Java applications using VS Code.

See if you can find the logical errors and correct them.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders:

- `src`: the folder to maintain source code
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
